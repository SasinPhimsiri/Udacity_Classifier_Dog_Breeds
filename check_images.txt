Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: In classifying Dog_01.jpg, Three model architectures predicted golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: In classifying Dog_02.jpg, Three model architectures predicted exactly differences in the classifications are as follows:
        - The Alexnet architecture predicted chihuahua
        - The Vgg architecture predicted llama
        - The ResNet architecture predicted siamese cat, siamese, cat


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: In classifying Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg, Three model architectures predicted to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Although The three models correctly predicted Dog_01.jpg. One of those that Alexnet correctly predicted IsDogs in Dog_02.jpg while the other models predicted another animal.
